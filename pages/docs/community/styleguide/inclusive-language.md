# Inclusive Language

While writing documentation we are indirectly reaching out to thousands of people all around the globe. 
Thus, we must ensure that our diverse audience can connect with our information. 

## 1. Culturally inclusive language

Some phrases and words are popularly used only in specific regions of the world, thus our audience from other parts 
of the world might need help to relate to the same. Hence, we should try to avoid using such phrases in our documentation. 
Some examples of Region Specific Language are -
- “It’s not rocket science” is commonly used in the USA, and non-US people might not be able to relate to it properly.
- Phrases written in regional languages instead of English.
- “It’s not a piece of cake” is commonly used in the USA, and non-US people might not be able to relate to it properly.

## 2. Gender neutral language 

Some phrases and words are targeting men or men/women specifically. This might result in other gender groups feeling 
left out while reading our documentation. Using only male pronouns, can make women in technology feel left out. 
Similarly, we should also try to include non binary group of people with our writing.
Some examples of Gender Neutral Language are -
- Using “they/them” instead of “his/him” or “she/her”.
- Using “Hello everyone” instead of “Hello guys”.
- Using “Chairperson” instead of “Chairman” or “Chairwoman”.
- Using "people", "guests" or "folks" instead of "ladies and gentlemen".
- Using "Mx" or "Ms" instead of using "Mr" or "Mrs".
- Avoid using sterotypes such as linking "male" with "strength", "women" with "care work", "male homosexuality" with "sensitivity".

## 3. People first language 

The placement of the word “People” matters a lot when it comes to writing documentation. 
Using the word “People” in the beginning makes it more pleasant as the problem is not displayed in the beginning.
Some examples of Gender Neutral Language are -
- Using “People with a mental health condition” instead of “Mentally Unstable People”.
- Using “Deaf” instead of “Person with deafness”.
- Using "People with a disability" instead of "Disabled eople".
- Using "Wheelchair Users" instead of "Wheelchair bound".
- Using "People experiencing homelessness" instead of "Homeless people"

## 4. Slang free language 

While framing the documentation, we must ensure that we are not including any vulgar language even if those are 
included indirectly in our work. Often we don’t realize that slang words are included within phrases which have 
don’t have collaborative slang meanings. 
Some examples include -
- Using “simple” or “easy" instead of “no-brainer”.
- Using "simple" or "straightforward" instead of "easy-peasy".
- Avoid using any racist, sexist, or any discriminatory language like "stupid" or "retarted".
- Using "easy" or "simple" instead of "piece of cake".
- Using "excellent" or "impressive" instead of "dope"

## 5. Ageism free language   

While constructing the documentation, we need to make sure to avoid words or phrases that might emphasize more 
on a specific age group that can make the other age groups feel left out. 
Some examples include -
- Avoid mentioning the exact age like “60 years” old.
- Using "experienced" instead of "old-timer"
- Avoid phrases like "you are too old to understand" or "you are too yound to understand"
- Using “lively” instead of “young”.
- Avoid making assumptions about a person's abilities or interests based on their age, like assuming an older adult will not be tech savvy.

## 6. Knowledge level assumption free language

While building the documentation, we should always assure that we don’t presume the knowledge level of the readers. 
This is because if we assume that our readers are highly skilled or have advanced experience, 
we might skip explaining or linking some important concepts. Also, we should avoid labeling some steps as “easy”, 
because this might make some readers question their technical abilities.
Some examples include -
- Using “fixing the navbar is good to start with” instead of “fixing the navbar is very easy”.
- Linking complex topics which most of our audience won’t be able to understand.
